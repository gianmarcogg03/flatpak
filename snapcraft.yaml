  **Snap is slow, limited and insecure**, Canonical has taken a very bad path since they shifted their focus from the desktop to the server space in 2017. From a business stand point, it made perfect sense, but they can't continue to make themselves look like the flagship Linux desktop company, because they just aren't that anymore.
  Ubuntu is no longer the great distro it once was, Snap and Snapcraft are just another nail in the coffin for it; you can tell because it took me less than 10 minutes to write up this troll listing.
